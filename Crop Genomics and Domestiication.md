The future of crop improvement will be centred on comparisons of individual plant genomes, and some of the best opportunities may lie in using combinations of new genetic mapping strategies and evolutionary analyses to direct and optimize the discovery and use of genetic variation. 
 
Summary
· Reference genome sequences from many important crops and several model plant species are enabling a number of new applications of crop comparative genomics.
· Compared with previous methods, comparative resequencing and high-density SNP genotyping permit much more detailed examination of crop evolutionary history and improve the potential to identify loci that are involved in plant domestication and improvement.
· Genome-wide association studies and a new generation of genetic-mapping populations will improve assessment of the genetic basis of trait variation.
· Deleterious mutations in individual genomes can be identified and selected against or even repaired.
· Genomic selection or genome-wide marker-assisted selection can incorporate prior information on the effects of markers and accelerate plant breeding cycles.
 
Comparative genomics
     synteny
     seq comparision
 
    estimate seq diversity by NGS
    Indel distribution
    CNV...
 
Goal of crop improvement
    increase production, feed the world
    minimizing the env impact 
    response to climate change 
    more and better nutrition. 
 
Challenges of plant genome 
    compare to human and other model systems: 
	· larger gene family
	· higher freq of poly
	· high diversity
	· large genome size
 
paralogy: due to duplication in a genome
 
Origin and evolution of crops
	· domestication shapes the genetic variation for breeding 
	· levels of nucleotide diversity and patterns of LD
	· predict genetic architecture
	· guideline for GWAS and molecular assistant breeding
 
Genetic basis of domestication
 
	1. model for adaptation
	2. shapes the genetic variation that is available to modern breeders. 
	3. influences the level of nucleotide diversity and LD.
	4. informs of expectations of the genetic architecture of traits of intest
	5. our ability of crop improvement
 
demographic inference
	· the divergence time between wild and crop is the divergence time to the MRCA. not the origin of domestication.
	· genetic bottleneck, use AFS
	· one time or multiple origin. 
			o both.  But the number of places still unknown.
	· admixture
	· haplotype structure. 
 
    
Genetic architecture 
 
The view that domestication involves few loci is probably limited by current poor mapping strategies can only identify loci of phenotypes than can be measured. 
	· limited to the genetic basis of domesticatoin syndrome traits   
	· limited phenotypes can be measured. 
	· domesticatoin probably involves many loci 
			o why: the complex nature of many domestication traits
			o unconscious selection.
	· Wright 33, 2-4% maize gene, 1300 genes were involved in maize domestication and subsequent improvement.
Not always adaptation
 molecular evidence can be shaped by the complex history and this species: introgression, 
the selective sweep model is too simple. not true. 
incomplete sweep
local adaptation (need geographically diverse sample)
multiple mutational origin, (standing variation)
Although CNV is prevalent between crop and wild, but little evidence to date support a prominent role for CNVs in domestication, 56
Although these is evidence of similarity in the genetic basis of domestication syndrome traits. BUT it is too early to determine whether there are strong commonalities among genes that have been selected during crop evolution. 
 
Deleterious mutation:
	· premature stop codon
	· splice site variants
	· indel => loss or impairment of protein function.
Deleterious mutation will accumulate in regions
	· where recombination is suppressed
	· drift in small population.
 
Plant breeding more focused on the immediate needs of farmers and end users:
	· Yeild
	· Disease resistance
	· agronomic performance
	· product quality. Nutrition, preservation.
 
Application
three area of evolution:
	· the genetic basis of adaptation
			o The identified targets of selection can be used as:
					§ the direct targets for future improvement. 
					§ careful reintroduction of diversity of nearby loci under selection. crop improvement was limited by selective sweep, bottleneck.
							§ from landrace and wild. 
							§ from genome editing.
					§ enhance recombination
					§ eliminate putative deleterious mutations
	· the quantification of variation
	· the processes of genetic transmission.
 
Next-generation mapping population. 
new genetic mapping strategies

How to deal with poly genome assembly
	· seq the diploid sister
	· one chromosome at a time
	· long reads 
	· Proximity ligation
	· HaploSeq 
	· in vivo and in vitro chromatin links (Hi-Seq)

small RNA (miRNA, siRNA,phasiRNA, hc-siRNA)
 
After poly:
gene, TE and small RNA all under relaxed selection
in soybean, duplicated miRNA retained higher than single copy
miRNAs might have a longer half-life than protein-coding genes following WGD events
wash-rinse-repeat cycle 
 
Ks:  ‘peaks’ of sequence similarity
sequence similarity among genes within genomes
 
genome's response to polyploid
	· immidediate response
			o homoeologous exchange
			o loss of duplicated gene
			o spread of TEs
			o mutation rate
			o expression bias
			o neo- sub- functionalization
			o genome structure rearrangements
 
Genes restored to single copy status 
	· often have broader expression domains and higher expression levels than those retained in duplicate
	· enriched for essential housekeeping functions, chloroplast-related functions, and functions in DNA replication and repair 
	· biased fractionation

```
In this review we explore how differences in population
genetic histories, as well as past selection for traits
of interest, have produced trait architectures and patterns
of linkage disequilibrium (LD) that frequently differ
dramatically between domesticated plants and humans,
making detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects
in crops more rewarding and less costly than in humans.
