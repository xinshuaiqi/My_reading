思考公司的大事
有见地，有胆识，有激情，有逻辑。
建构和导师，同伴的关系。

领导力的基础，是每个层面的通透。

不要误认为自己需要与周围的人竞争，应该是和他们合作才对。

决策之前提出的意见才有价值。都有潜在价值
想领导者一样思考，为他们减轻负担。

连续不断的成功可以产生势头。有势头的领导者看上去比实际更优秀。

了解下属的需要，而不是想当然给他们你认为他们需要的。

一个固守职位的人永远无法影响到其他的人。

**66%人认为 领导力是由成就决定的**

领导和经营有很大的区别

表现欠佳的员工：培训，调动，解雇。

伟大的领导者与他人分享所学所得

领导者缺少承诺和责任心，大的目标，会导致周围的人也受到影响。


# 21：
领导力决定办事效率
要有影响力，大家愿意听你说
需要日积月累
人们愿意追随比自己强的人
培养追随者
